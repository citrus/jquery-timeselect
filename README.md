jQuery.timeselect.js
====================

Almost identical to [jquery.timepickr.js](http://haineault.com/media/jquery/ui-timepickr/page/), but roughly 10% it's size.

Usage
-----

Make sure you're including jquery first, then add the following to your document's head:

    <link href="stylesheets/jquery.timeselect.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <script src="javascripts/jquery.timeselect.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
Then, attach time select to your input:

    $(document).ready(function() {
      $("#time").timeselect();
    });

Customize jquery.timeselect.css for bonus points.

Enjoy!
